### Dev Log: (MM-DD-YYYY: "LOG")
* #### Yuxiang Huang:
    *  (05-23-2022): "Today I created the backbone of the project with Daniel in class, so I put it in main.(Totally not because I forgot to checkout into the branch I am working in). After class, to minimize merge conflict, I decided to work on the Polygon class and finished the constructors and displays for Square and Triangle, leaving the pentagon for tomorrow."
    *  (05-24-2022): "Today I finished pentagon, the last one of the polygons. Then, I tested their constructor and displays by creating 9 polygons randomly and resolve all the issues I encountered. Lastly, I colored them."
* #### Daniel Yentin:
    *  (05-23-2022): "Today I began coding the project. I worked on the PBP (main) class as well as the Gunship class. I was able to create a circle that can move smoothly in all 8 directions."

### Brief Summary:
We will attempt to recreate the shooter game Diep.io (an Agar.io clone) with no multiplayer, but bot enemies that you need to defeat. The MVP will focus on the movement1, stat upgrades2, and level up mechanics (including polygons), and the Final Project will focus on adding tank upgrades and bot enemies.

By shooting enemies you can gain experience points, which once you acquire enough off to level up, you gain a skill point that lets you upgrade a stat of your player. The playable map will be bigger than the entire screen, meaning the camera won't just be a static overhead view, but one that moves along with your ship, always keeping it in focus (orthographic camera).

Once we are done with the MVP (~1 week) we can start working on the actual final project. The main focus of the actual project is to add a tree of tank upgrades that allow you to attack differently and have different attributes. We will also want to add bot enemies, which are also tanks.
